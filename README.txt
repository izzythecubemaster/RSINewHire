This is the RSI New Hire page, a brand new addition to the RSI website that provides peace
of mind to new RSI employees and interns. It's clean, modern, and designed
to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones. It also runs in fast pure HTML5 with no
additional plugins or addons to keep the loading times fast, and the resources used low.
